### `FileUpload.jsx`

 A powerful and customizable CSV uploader with metadata-aware parsing and advanced filtering support for React. Built with Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, and PapaParse, this component allows users to:

Upload and validate .csv files.

Automatically parse structured multi-row headers.

Preserve metadata rows.

Preview and filter the parsed data interactively.

Proceed with filtered data for further usage (e.g., chart generation or exporting).

### `Header.jsx`
Renders a top-level navigation bar that adapts to screen size.

Desktop (md+): Shows tabs horizontally with icons.

Mobile (<md): Displays a <select> dropdown for navigation.

### `Patient.jsx`
The Patient component is a comprehensive UI module for:

Displaying a patient's details

Uploading, previewing, and storing PDF prescriptions

Managing localStorage to persist file uploads across sessions

patient: object ‚Äì Patient data with fields like name, age, etc.

onBack: function ‚Äì Callback to go back to the previous view
 
1. Patient Info Display
Extracts common patient metadata (like name, age, diagnosis, etc.).

Keys defined in DISPLAY_KEYS array.

Shown in a responsive 2-column layout using Tailwind grid.

2. PDF Prescription Upload
Allows users to upload up to 3 PDF files, with:

Individual file size ‚â§ 5 MB

File type must be application/pdf

Duplicate name/size prevention

Each upload is converted to Base64 using FileReader

Base64 string saved in localStorage with metadata

3. localStorage Management
Uses a unique key per patient (e.g., patient_pdfs_123)

Automatically saves and loads PDFs from localStorage

Removes all files if prescription list is emptied

Manages storage quota (limit: ~5MB)

 4. Storage Usage Indicator
Shows real-time usage of localStorage visually:

Storage bar with size (e.g., 1.2 MB / 5 MB)

Dynamically updated after each upload/delete

5. File Management
Uploaded files appear in a list with:

Name (linked to download)

File size and upload date

Delete button (Trash2)

### `SavedFiles.jsx`
It displays and manages a list of saved CSV files that a user previously uploaded, providing options to view, download, delete, or analyze each file.

 Main Functionalities:
Load and Display Saved CSV Files
Loads files from a local IndexedDB (or another client-side storage via dbOperations.getAllCsvFiles()).

Each file includes metadata: name, number of rows, columns, upload date, and optional description.

 Show File and Chart Stats
 
Calls dbOperations.getStats() to show:

Total CSV files uploaded

Total charts saved

Total data points (sum of rows across files)
 
Clicking ‚ÄúLoad & Analyze‚Äù runs onLoadFile(...) to send the file data to a parent component for analysis/charting.
 
Deletes a file after user confirmation using dbOperations.deleteCsvFile(...).
 
Allows downloading the file as a .csv by generating a Blob and triggering a download.
 
"Upload New File" button triggers onCreateNew() to open an upload UI (handled by the parent).

 ### `SaveDialog.jsx`

1. Collect File Metadata
Allows the user to:

Enter a file name (required)

Enter an optional description

If data and headers are provided, it shows a mini summary:

Number of rows

Number of columns

First 3 column headers

3. Save the File
When the "Save File" button is clicked:

Validates that a file name is entered.

Calls onSave(name, description) (passed in as a prop).

Shows a loading spinner while saving.

Closes the modal after a successful save.

4.  Close the Dialog
Clicking the  icon or "Cancel" button closes the modal via onClose().

### `TrackProgress.jsx`
1. Receive and Process Patient Data
Takes savedDetails (array of rows) as a prop.

Filters out invalid header rows or empty names.

Ensures each patient has a serial number (S. NO.); if missing, generates one with a fallback like patient-0-<timestamp>.

Stores the cleaned-up list in the patients state.

2. Search Patients Dynamically
The user can search by:

Name

Age

Contact Number

Serial Number

Filters patient list in real time using useMemo.

3. Display Patient Cards
For each filtered patient:

Shows Name, Serial Number, Age, and Contact.

Cards are responsive and interactive.

Clicking a card triggers onViewPatientDetails(patient) ‚Üí likely opens a detailed view or modal.

4. Handles Edge Cases Gracefully
If no savedDetails ‚Üí shows a default "no data" message.

If no matches found from search ‚Üí shows a specific "no matching results" message.

Uses fallback text ('-') if fields like name, age, or contact are missing.
